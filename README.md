# **Pig\_Game**

This is a production of the Pig (Dice Game). Dices are rolled which determine the points that the current player may receive. The next player would also roll the die for points. Whoever reaches 25 points first wins the game. Other rules of the game are explained below which make the game even more interesting!

The reason for this game is practicing core JavaScript concepts and how DOM manipulation works and how the interaction with the user can be maintained. I thought it was a fun exercise! And I hope you have fun too.

# **Instructions**

To get the game running, navigate to the folder containing the game and open up the index.html document with your web-browser(I used Google Chrome)! That should start the game.

The game is meant for 2 players. Click on the roll dice red button in the center to roll the two dice.

If any of the dice is 1, it would switch to the other player and this round for you ends. Otherwise the sum of the two dice would be added to your score for this round score. The round score is the total amount of points you have accumulated in this turn with the die in your possession; it is written on the red box which says &quot;current&quot;.

If after your round score exceeds 10 and you roll an even number, your round/turn immediately ends and your total score(written above the current/ round score) gets subtracted by double the sum of the roll from the two dice. This is to dissuade you from continuously rolling and play a patient game.

Obviously, in your turn you can continue rolling the dice if you don&#39;t roll a 1 or an even number if your round score exceeds 10. But it may be better off to play it safe!

So to add your round score to your total score and give the turn over to your opponent, click on &quot;Hold&quot; in the middle!

The first person to reach 30 points for the Total score wins!

I hope you all have fun with this game and of course alot of other rules can be added to make it more interesting. Let me know what you have in mind.
